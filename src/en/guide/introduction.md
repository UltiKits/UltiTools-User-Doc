# Introduction

## What is UltiTools?

First released in 2020 and now at v6.2.x, UltiTools uses a **core + modules** architecture: the core framework handles module loading, data storage, and configuration, while all features (essentials, chat, menus, economy, etc.) are provided as independent modules that you install on demand.

- **Multiple Storage Backends**: JSON, SQLite, and MySQL
- **Cloud Panel**: Manage your server remotely via [panel.ultikits.com](https://panel.ultikits.com)

- **Completely Free**: All features are free and open-source
